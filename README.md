# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays using CNN

This project uses deep learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) to classify chest X-ray images into:
- Normal
- Pneumonia

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The model is trained on a dataset of X-ray images
2. You can give it a new image and it will tell you if pneumonia is present

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Train the model:
```bash
python train_model.py
2. Predict from an image:
python predict.py
The output will say either:

"🫁 Pneumonia detected"

or "✅ Lungs look normal"
